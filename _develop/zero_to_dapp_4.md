This page assumes you have customized and deployed your Animal Kingdom as
[described in part 3](zero_to_dapp_3).

## Add your Animal Kingdom to App.co

App.co accepts applications from all decentralized protocols such as Ethereum,
Blockstack, and many others. When you add an app, it is not automatically
eligible for application mining, you must submit it using an another procedure.
You can also submit an application for App Mining but not add it to App.co.

In this section, you add your Animal Kingdom to the **Blockstack Sample
Application** category on App.co.  Adding your Animal Kingdom app to this
category earns you a limited edition a Zero-to-DApp t-shirt. Only submit your
sample application if you have deployed the application on the internet. This
allows us to confirm you completed the tutorial. You can submit more than one
example, only your first submission receives a t-shirt.

To add an app, do the following:

1. In your browser, navigate to <a href="https://app.co/" target="\_blank">the App.co website</a>.
2. Choose **Add your app** option from the menu.

   The system opens the submit your App form.

## Submit a DApp to App Mining

Only applications that integrate Blockstack authentication and
that are accessible to review can participate in application mining (App Mining).

To submit an application for App Mining, you select <a href="https://app.co/mining" target="\_blank" style="color:blue;">App Mining</a> from the App.co menu and then select the **Submit your app for qualification** button. Blockstack sample applications that you create from our tutorials such as this one don't qualify for application mining.

Your submission is evaluated internally to check if it passes the basic
requirements. After it passes, we accept the app and contact you to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/develop/mining_enroll.html" target="\_blank">submit
additional materials</a>.
