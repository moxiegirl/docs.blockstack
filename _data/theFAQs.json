         "question": "What is Blockstack?",
         "answer": "<p>Blockstack is a full-stack decentralized computing network that enables a new generation of applications where developers and users can interact fairly and securely. Blockstack uses blockchain technology to build protocols and developer tools designed to enable a fair and open Internet that returns digital rights to developers and consumers. Led by some of the world’s foremost experts on distributed systems, Blockstack allows users to own their own data that they can take with them from app to app in the ecosystem, along with their Blockstack ID that eliminates the need for password-based logins. The end result is privacy, security, and freedom.</p>"

         "question": "What is decentralized computing?",
         "answer": "<p>Decentralized computing has these attributes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Personal keys for a digital life</strong>. Users will have keys that unlock all their software interactions, email, subscriptions, and social. These keys are in users’ hands and under their control similar to physical keys (in some cases they are physical). Corporations  no longer create or manage these keys.</li> <li><strong>Security is a first-class concern</strong>.  Users want systems that protect both their identity and the data associated with that identity — health, application, and relationships.</li> <li><strong>Convenient and auditable.</strong> Applications will be readily available as cloud applications are today but will be written with open protocols and code that allow them to be audited.</li> <li><strong>Innovation focused.</strong> The code and data in a decentralized computing lacks corporate and other boundaries, as a result, a global workforce can easily contribute and benefit from them.</li> </ul> <p>Blockstack technology is a shift in how people use software, create it, and benefit from the internet. It puts people back in control of the computing systems that manage today’s world.</p>"

         "question": "What is the Blockstack Ecosystem?",
         "answer": "<p>The Blockstack Ecosystem is the legal entities and community structures that support the Blockstack technology, the apps that rely on it, and the people that work with it. The ecosystem’s mission is to foster an open and decentralized Internet that establishes and protects privacy, security, and freedom for all users.</p> <p>There are multiple business entities that have been created to focus on advancing the ecosystem, <a href='https://blog.blockstack.org/a-path-to-decentralization/'>with plans for further decentralization</a>:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Blockstack PBC</strong> is a Public Benefit Corp that drives the development of the core Blockstack protocol and developer tools. Blockstack PBC was founded in 2013 by Princeton computer scientists and after 4+ years of R&amp;D, launched the Blockstack Platform alpha in early 2017. The Blockstack Platform is the easiest way to start building decentralized, blockchain-based applications. It provides a complete decentralized application stack, powered by the Stacks blockchain, and maintained by a open-source community.</li> <li><strong>Blockstack Token LLC</strong> is the entity responsible for developing and commercializing the Stacks tokens in a manner that is approved by the SEC. Blockstack Token LLC works on regulatory filings and compliance for the Stacks token. The LLC conducted the 2017 token offering to accredited investors. Stacks tokens created by Blockstack Token LLC were distributed in the genesis block of the Stacks blockchain in Fall 2018.</li> <li><strong>Blockstack Signature Fund</strong> <strong>I</strong> is a fund comprised of multiple VCs representing $25 million in funding that makes opportunistic investments in the ecosystem &emdash; whether it be Blockstack applications or into tools and platforms that accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. Learn more about <a href='https://signature.vc/'>the Signature Fund</a>.</li> <li><strong>Non-profit Foundation</strong> Blockstack PBC intends to assist in the formation of a non-profit foundation dedicated to supporting fundamental digital rights and ensuring that core internet infrastructure remains decentralized. In the future, it may support people and projects with funding, research grants, or other. </li> <li><strong>New Internet Labs</strong> is an independent company headquartered in Hong Kong and founded by Larry Salibra, an early employee of Blockstack PBC and long-time Blockstack contributor. New Internet Labs serves as an App Reviewer as part of the <a href='https://app.co/mining'>App Mining</a> program and working to develop a browser for the decentralized internet. Learn more about <a href='https://www.newinternetlabs.com/'>their efforts here</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Any person or organization working with the Blockstack technology in the open-source ecosystem is considered a part of it.

         "question": "What is a decentralized internet?",
         "answer": "<p>We envision an internet where users control their data, and power flows back to the users. A decentralized internet was how the internet was intended to be, a place where application creators cannot sell data without a user’s authorization. Users choose which data to share and who to share it with. In a decentralized internet, no single company or organization tracks users’ activities without permission, and that permission is the users to give or to take away.</p>"

         "question": "What can developers achieve with the Blockstack Ecosystem?",
         "answer": "<p>The Blockstack Ecosystem is working to enable developers to build software that protects users’ digital rights. This new kind of software is known as decentralized applications or DApps.</p> <p>DApps use blockchain technology. Where Bitcoin is a decentralized value exchange on a blockchain, DApps use blockchain technology for more than value exchange; they use a blockchain to exchange data and support application interactions.</p> <p>Decentralized applications potentially represent the next generation of computing. In an entirely decentralized world, all things occur using peer-to-peer networks, and the idea of centralized entities are non-existent. This distributed future is still being designed and built, but the early stages of development are looking promising.</p>"

         "question": "What problems do Blockstack DApps solve for me as a user?",
         "answer": "<p>Applications developed with Blockstack’s technology run like the traditional, web applications you know. Unlike traditional, web applications, DApps avoid abusing users by adhering to the following principles:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Users control their data, not the application developer.</strong> If you stop using an application, the application cannot access your data. When you leave the application, you take your data with you.</li> <li><strong>Users determine where to store their data.</strong> You can store your data on your computer. Alternatively, you can choose highly-available commercial storage providers you trust. The providers can only host your data; it is encrypted so they cannot <q>unlock</q> it to view.</li> <li><strong>Users control which applications and which third parties can access their data.</strong> Applications ask your permission to read your data, and you can withdraw those same permissions at any time. Applications cannot sell or mine your data on behalf of a third party you are unaware of.</li> </ul>"

         "category": "general",
         "question": "What problems does Blockstack solve for application developers?",
         "answer": "<ul> <li>Blockstack wraps blockchain operations in traditional REST calls. Developers can start programming using the same Javascript functionality they are currently familiar with.</li> <li>Application data is stored off the blockchain for performance and scalability.</li> <li>Blockstack ensures that all user data is signed and verified and (optionally) encrypted end-to-end, so users and developers can treat storage providers like dumb hard drives.</li> <li>Developers do not host user data. Since users supply their storage and use public-key cryptography for authentication, applications don’t have to store anything–there’s nothing to steal when applications are hacked.</li> <li>Moreover, many Web applications today can be refactored so that everything happens client-side, obviating the need for running dedicated application servers.</li> </ul> "

         "question": "Who started Blockstack?",
         "answer": "<p>Blockstack was founded by two engineers from Princeton University, Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea. They met at the Computer Science department at Princeton, where Muneeb was finishing his Ph.D. and Ryan was running the entrepreneurship club. In 2013, frustrated by the walled-gardens and security problems of the current internet they started working on a decentralized internet secured by blockchains. Blockstack is an open source project, and you can <a href='https://github.com/blockstack'>find the code on GitHub</a>.</p>"

      {
         "category": "appusers",
         "question": "How do DApps differ from applications I typically use?",
         "answer": "<p>DApps (decentralized applications) differ from Web applications in these key ways:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Users have identities, not accounts.</strong> The user brings their identity to the applications; applications do not require the user to create accounts and passwords. A user can use a single identity on all applications.</li> <li><strong>Users determine where to store their application data.</strong> They can store their data on their computer or with a commercial cloud storage provider.</li> <li><strong>Users control data access.</strong> Users control access to their data. Software creators and their decentralized applications don’t keep or save your data. When a user logs into a DApp with an identity, the user gives the DApp authority to read existing data or write new data. When a user disconnects from a DApp, it no longer has access to the user data.</li> </ul>"

      {
         "category": "appusers",
         "question": "What is an identity or ID or Blockstack identity?",
         "answer": "<p>A name or identity, ID for short, is your <q>home</q> on the decentralized internet. Your identity is unique, like a passport number, only you have it. To use an application, you sign into the application with your identity and a secret key only you know.</p> <p>Your data and where it is stored is connected with your identity. When you sign into a DApp, you give the DApp permission to read your data and write to your data store on your behalf. When you log out of an application, it no longer has access to your data or data store — until the next time you log in with your identity.</p>"

         "category": "appusers",
         "question": "Do I need to keep my identity secret?",

      {
         "category": "appusers",
         "question": "How do I get an identity? Is it free?",
         "answer": "<p>Normally, registering an identity as a digital asset on the Stacks blockchain requires <a href='https://blog.blockstack.org/video-reusing-bitcoins-hashpower-to-launch-the-stacks-blockchain/'>burning of Stacks tokens as <em>fuel</em></a>. However, Blockstack PBC is currently running a free service to pay for identities on behalf of the users. Through this service, you can get a free identity from Blockstack in the <strong>id.blockstack</strong> namespace. A namespace is similar to a domain (<strong>checklist.com</strong>, for example) on the old internet. So, a free identity has blockstack suffix in its name; for example, <strong>moxiegirl.id.blockstack</strong> is a free Blockstack identity.</p>"

         "category": "appusers",
         "question": "If I forget my identity or my lose my secret key, can Blockstack help me?",
         "answer": "<p>If you forget your identity or lose your secret key, no one else, <em>no person, no software, can help you get your identity back</em>. This restriction protects your identity and your secret key which together control access to data about you. In the new, decentralized internet, no one can keep and store your data but you, not even Blockstack.</p> <p>You need to keep your identity and secret key in a safe, secure place you won’t forget.</p> "

         "answer": "<p>Yes, you can get an identity in the .id space without Blockstack in the name. For example, you can create <strong>steve.id</strong>. You can even create a different space like <strong><em>username</em></strong><strong>.frank</strong> without the id designation. These identities (<strong>.id</strong>) are not free; they cost a small amount of Bitcoin. A space (<strong>.frank</strong>) takes some technical knowledge to create and cost more.</p>"

Names that have a single dot like <strong>name.namespace</strong> expire according to the rules set by the <strong>namespace</strong> creators.  For example, <strong>name.id</strong> in the <strong>id</strong> namespace expires every two years and must be renewed. If a <strong>name.id</strong> expires, someone else can claim it.</p>"

         "answer": "<p>Your email is not kept by DApps or by Blockstack. It is stored in your browser client’s local web storage. (See the question about data storage for more information about web storage.) When you are logged into a DApp, it can use your email to send you any information you need to operate the DApp. When you log out, your email is no longer available to the DApp.</p>"

From the Blockstack Browser tab, you can find DApps to try, update settings related to your identity and storage &ndash; and much more.</p> <p>Developers use the Blockstack Browser to handle login requests from DApps. From a Blockstack DApp, a user chooses the Log In with Blockstack button. Clicking this button sends users to a Blockstack Browser dialog.

         "question": "Where is the data about me kept or what is a data store?",
         "answer": "<p>Data about you appears in two locations, browser web storage and a data store. Web storage lives in your browser client, Chrome, Safari, and so forth. Data in web storage is sparse, it never leaves your device (computer or phone), and it is temporary. You can clear or remove your web storage just as you can your browser’s cache. Web storage data includes your email and your encrypted identity. Web storage never leaves your browser and never crosses a network to an external server.</p> <p>Your Blockstack identity and any connected application data are kept in your data store. Unlike web storage, a data store has to live on a server accessible via the internet. That server is running the Gaia Storage System. The Gaia Storage System keeps the data encrypted. When you use an application, you give it permission to read and write from your data store. The application needs your permission to decrypt the data.</p>"

That email is in your browser’s web storage; it doesn’t leave your device (computer or phone). When you reset the Blockstack Browser or clear your browser’s web storage, the local storage and your email are removed.</p>"

         "answer": "<p>A data storage provider is a person or a company that runs a Blockstack Gaia Storage System. You could, for example, run a Gaia Storage System on your own. Blockstack assumes that most users will use a commercial storage provider rather than a personal one.</p> <p>Commercial storage providers typically use cloud computing services such as Digital Ocean, Amazon, or S3. These have the advantage of larger drives, regular backups, and more secure storage. Individual users can use these too, or they can use a local drive.</p> <p>A Gaia Storage System has a location (URL) on the internet. The URL for a user’s storage provider is stored in their zone file. You can get a zone file with <code>blockstack-cli</code> <code>lookup</code> in the CLI.

Developers don’t have to worry about running servers, maintaining databases, or building out user management systems.</p> <p>Developers build an application in Javascript using the <a href='https://blockstack.github.io/blockstack.js/'>blockstack.js</a> library. This library handles everything from identity and authentication to data storage. Applications can request permissions from users for read and write access to user resources. Data is stored off the blockchain in a storage provider running Blockstack’s Gaia Storage system. Gaia is simple and reliable and uses existing cloud infrastructure.</p> <p>Under the hood, Blockstack provides a decentralized domain name system, the Blockstack Naming System (BNS). BNS is a decentralized public key distribution system and registry for apps and user identities.</p>"

         "answer": "<p>The application should not run application-specific functionality on a server. All of its functionality should run on end-points. Serverless can also mean applications where the application developer still writes some amount of server-side logic, but unlike traditional architectures, this logic is run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and ephemeral (may only last for one invocation).</p> <p>However, applications may use some servers with the caveat that they must not be part of the application’s trusted computing base. The Gaia Storage System is part of most DApps’  computing base, but because user data is signed and verified end-to-end, the storage systems are not trusted to always serve correct data.</p>"

In the Blockstack Ecosystem, instead of just mining through computation, developers mine by building apps and the Blockstack community funds them simply for being pioneers in the emerging Blockchain software market.</p> <p>We believe app mining represents a revolution in app funding, allowing small teams to bootstrap without advertising or venture capital. Each month, qualifying apps compete for funding. Qualified apps are evaluated and ranked by expert app reviewers. The better your app, the higher payout you earn.</p> <p>The pilot run began on December 1st 2018, with 34 Blockstack Apps enrolled. A previous alpha run in Oct 2018 included 17 Blockstack apps. App mining is a new mining model that we expect will evolve and improve over time. We look forward to feedback from our community regarding the App Mining process and program.</p>"

Similar to how Bitcoin upgrades, a new feature is activated if a certain threshold (e.g., 80%) of votes consistently request its adoption over a given time interval (e.g., a couple of weeks).</p> <p>Until then, Blockstack publicly announces the availability of new software, with the promise that each release will bring highly-desired features to make upgrading worth the users’ whiles.</p>"

Just as with a banking pin, anyone that knows or steals your seed phrase can access your allocation.</p> <p>You should write your seed phrase down and store the paper you write on in at least two secure locations. A safe or lock box is a good location. You can also store it online in an encrypted password manager such as 1Password.

These states also maintain that their ability to require this registration is not preempted by the federal securities laws.   While we do not necessarily agree with these states’ positions on these matters, proceeding with the cash offering in these states without complying with their dealer-registration requirements might subject us to litigation risk, and we are not able to comply with these dealer-registration requirements at this time.   We are continuing to examine ways in which we may be able to comply with the dealer-registration requirements or otherwise offer Stacks Tokens in these states.  We will evaluate participation by developers in the App Mining program on a case-by-case basis to review if there is an applicable exemption under state law for each developer, but otherwise developers from these states will also be excluded from the App Mining program.</p>"

Tokens subject to transfer locks are non-transferable on the Blockstack network until a one-year holding period following their sale has lapsed. A token can be burned on the network while subject to a transfer lock (provided it is not subject to a time lock), but otherwise is non-transferable.</p> <p>Separately, tokens on the Blockstack network can be subject to a time lock, a general restriction that prevents a Stacks token from being used for any purpose on the Blockstack network, such that the Stacks token cannot be burned or transferred. Time locks operate such that Stacks tokens unlock in equal increments each time a pre-set number of blocks is processed on the blockchain.</p>"

         "question": "What types of transfer or time locks apply to the current and future sales of Stacks tokens?",
         "answer": "<p><u>2019 Regulation A offering</u>: Stacks tokens sold pursuant to our Regulation A offering are subject to an approximately two-year time lock from the date of the hard fork that distributes the tokens. 1/24th of the amount of tokens purchased will be released from this time lock on the date of distribution of the tokens, and an additional 1/24th will be released approximately every month. These tokens will not be subject to a transfer lock.</p> <p><u>2019 Regulation S offering</u>: Stacks tokens sold pursuant to our Regulation S offering to non-U.S. institutional investors are subject to a one-year transfer lock from the date of sale and an approximately two-year time lock that unlocks on an approximately monthly basis from the date of the hard fork that distributes the tokens.</p> <p><u>2017 Accredited Investor Sale</u>: Stacks tokens sold pursuant to our Regulation D offering to accredited investors in 2017 are subject to an approximately two-year time lock that unlocks on an approximately monthly basis from the date of the genesis block, except for 50,000,000 of those tokens, which are subject to an approximately four-year time lock. The tokens were previously subject to a one-year transfer lock, which has expired.</p> <p><u>2017 Founder Sale &amp; Equity Investor Sale</u>: Stacks tokens sold to founders and certain stockholders of Blockstack PBC in 2017 are subject to an approximately three-year time lock that unlocks on an approximately monthly basis from the date of the genesis block.</p>"

         "question": "How will mining affect the supply of Stacks tokens?",
         "answer": "<p>Mining is not currently available on the Blockstack network. As a result, we expect the supply of 1.32 billion Stacks tokens created in the <a href='https://blog.blockstack.org/the-launch-of-the-stacks-genesis-block/'>genesis block</a> to decline over time due to burning.</p><p>We hope to introduce mining in or around 2020, which may increase the token supply through the creation of tokens as mining rewards. We anticipate that the number of tokens added will be governed by a principle that we call <q>adaptive mint and burn,</q> which provides that a minimum number of new Stacks tokens will be created as the mining reward for each block added to the blockchain, and a number of additional tokens may also be included in the mining reward to replace tokens that have been recently burned and thereby removed from the token supply, which additional tokens we refer to as <q>replacement</q> tokens. The number of tokens recently burned would be calculated using a measurement algorithm that remains to be determined.</p> <p>Unless the number of tokens burned exceeds the maximum number of additional tokens that can be created, or the measurement algorithm fails to accurately measure the rate at which tokens are being burned,  adaptive mint and burn will result in a net number of tokens being added to the token supply each year equal to the minimum number of tokens created — which would be equal to approximately 26,298,000 tokens each year for the first five years, 21,038,400 tokens each year over the next five years, and then 15,778,800 tokens each year after that.   If the token-burning activity on the network consistently exceeds the cap on token creation, however, more tokens may be burned than are replaced by the replacement tokens, and this could result in less net tokens being added to the network over time than anticipated.</p> <p>In addition, the blockchain would further add to the token supply by creating 12 million new Stacks tokens a year for App Mining, and 25 million tokens and 15 million tokens the first and second year after the introduction of mining, respectively, for user incentive programs. We are considering whether these caps on the number of additional tokens should be removed at some time in the future.</p> <p>For more details, please see <q><em>Description of the Stacks Tokens—Creation of new Stacks Tokens</em></q> <a href='https://stackstoken.com/circular'>in our offering circular</a>.</p>"

We anticipate that approximately 2,048,036,800 Stacks tokens will be in circulation in the year 2050 based on the assumption that mining is introduced in 2020, and fewer tokens than this estimate may be in circulation.

Blockstack PBC raised $47.5M in this offering.</p> <p>Holders of Blockstack’s Series A convertible preferred stock—who had invested a total of $5.1 million as of late 2016 and funded Blockstack’s early growth and development before the decision to create a token, or the drafting or publication of any white papers—were also provided an opportunity to purchase tokens at a nominal price per token before the 2017 Reg D offering. This opportunity to participate at a nominal price was given in return for their early support and in proportion to their equity ownership, and it was based on their reasonable expectation as early investors that they would receive tokens if Blockstack ever decided to create a digital token.</p> <p>These tokens are subject to a three-year time lock, commencing upon the introduction of the genesis block to the Blockstack network in November 2018.
